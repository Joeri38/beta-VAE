model.py:122:12: WARNING: *.save requires manual check. (This warning is only applicable if the code saves a tf.Keras model) Keras model.save now saves to the Tensorflow SavedModel format by default, instead of HDF5. To continue saving to HDF5, add the argument save_format='h5' to the save() function.
model.py:177:28: WARNING: tf.get_variable requires manual check. tf.get_variable returns ResourceVariables by default in 2.0, which have well-defined semantics and are stricter about shapes. You can disable this behavior by passing use_resource=False, or by calling tf.compat.v1.disable_resource_variables().
